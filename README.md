# Yelp Recommendations - Web Scrapping (CSC365)
**Objective:** Using the publicly available Yelp dataset, generate recommended business similar to one the user selects. Similarity is determined by comparing word frequencies in reviews associated with different businesses. Using this similarity metric, group the business into a number of clusters. Then construct a weighted graph of businesses, where each business is connected to its four geographical closest neighbors. Allow the user to select two businesses on this graph and generate the shortest weighted path between them.
